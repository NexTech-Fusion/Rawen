# 🐦‍⬛🌟 Rawen
Rawen is an innovative command framework to build a desktop application that is highly flexibile and programmable. 
It comes with a suite of built-in functions that provide robust control over each instance of the application.

🚧 Current Development Status
We are currently engaged in a comprehensive refactoring process, aiming to tidy up the codebase in preparation for its public release. 
While this process is underway, users can still leverage the power of Rawen through our SDK or the integrated IDE within a Rawen instance. 
This allows for the customization and programming of commands to suit diverse needs.

💼 For Businesses and Auditing
We understand the importance of transparency and trust, especially for corporate clients. 
Companies interested in utilizing Rawen and requiring access to the source code for auditing purposes can rest assured 🛡️. 
We are committed to providing such access to ensure compliance with your internal standards and security requirements.

Stay tuned for further updates 📢 and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
